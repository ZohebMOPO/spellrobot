## Inspiration
As we were supposed to build something magical yet useful, we came up with the idea to build a robot (or shall we call it a goblin?) that reacts according to the spells cast through our webpage. 
## What it does
It is a wireless robot that is connected to our webpage through API and can be controlled from anywhere. "Spells" can be cast through our webpage, where the user can order it to move into any direction.
## How we built it
We used ReactJS for the website. The "goblin" or robot was built using NodeMCU, Lithium Ion Battery, Motors and motor driver. We used PHP to connect our web app to the bot, by sending requests from web app to our server and repeatedly pinging it from the NodeMCU.
## Challenges we ran into
We tried to add the API to our website but there was some `CORS` problem which almost took a day to complete.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we finally made the project work successfully
## What we learned
We learned how to connect a website to hardware. We also learned how to make `APIs` using PHP.
## What's next for Spellbound Robot
We are looking forward to making a native app with this and expanding the controls we have.
